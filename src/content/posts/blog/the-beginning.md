Today, i woke up with that weird obssesion again. I am researching every video, every article out there talking getting into google.
With time I came to understand that google is not my goal per se, but what my mind thinks as being succesfull as a software engineer.
I read a lot of articles and success stories out there, so inspiring! But I should make no mistake, getting there is a painful process, 
and especially for me. I am in no priveleged position to say the least. Morocco isn't known particularly for it's brilliant engineers although 
there are many that I know of.
I know that I am procrastinating, I need to work and forget about this obsession taking me from article to article in an internet traversal that wouldtake a awefull lot of time.
I know some essential things already, what to study, how to prepare, what resources to use, how to craft your resume, but I cant know everything.
I decided to stop, time for pre-preparing is done, and the tim for the journey has come.
In order to reach my goal, I should put some basic goals and milestones for myself.

I have roughly 5 months to prepare:

- I should start applying by early August(final resume)
- I should build my personal Blog which has: * an algorithm visualization and data structures implementations 
                                             * leetcode, google code jam(look at solutions of tourist), codeforces problems solved and explained
                                             * list of contributions to open source projects
                                             * what I understand of articles I read
